# instant http!

A humble scala alternative to `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

* simple installation with [Conscript][cs]

    cs softprops/unplanned

will install a conscript called `up` in your local `~/bin` directory.

Then, from any directory containing static files just type `up` and you get an
instant http server listening on the first available port.

Need a specific port? Use `up -p 8080`.

That is all.
